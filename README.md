### Goal 4. Equality Education
   We provide equal opportunities to learn Taekwondo to people with intellectual disabilities.
   This application can solve the problem that you want to learn but can't because you don't have the opportunity.
      

### Goal 10. Reduced Inequalities
   Most gyms do not provide opportunities for people with intellectual disabilities to learn sports, citing the reason that people with intellectual disabilities cannot take classes with the general public.
   Therefore, I believe that if they are provided with equal learning opportunities and the demand increases, gyms targeting people with intellectual disabilities will be created.
   If people with intellectual disabilities show more interest in physical education classes and demand it from society, inequality in opportunities can gradually be resolved.


## Project Outline

### 🎯 Project Goal

* Goal
    * By developing a non-face-to-face special sports application for people with intellectual disabilities, we aim to provide them with opportunities to experience special sports and improve their physical and mental health.
    * In particular, we adopted Taekwondo, which can be practiced regardless of location and tool, and developed an effective and professional education application through collaboration with Taekwondo experts who directly educate people with intellectual disabilities.
      
* Core Features
    * Learn posture through Taekwondo learning videos filmed by Taekwondo experts
    * When you film your posture through a camera, feedback is provided based on the similarity to a model posture.
    * Considering that the target users of the application are people with intellectual disabilities, we add interesting elements such as music and praise stickers to enable continuous learning.

### 👀 Description of application execution process 


1 ) When visiting the application for the first time, users can automatically sign up as members by simply entering their age.

  * Considering the fact that the user is an intellectually disabled person, the complexity of the app was minimized.

2 ) When you take a picture of yourself, it recognizes your movements and analyzes the similarity to a model posture.

  * As a result of testing the application with actual intellectually disabled people, they showed great interest when they switched to selfie mode and took pictures of themselves.
  * If you repeat the same action three times, learning ends with a badge awarded.

3 ) You can get rewards for learning through badges.

  * Most programs that educate people with intellectual disabilities use a compliment sticker board, and our application includes that function as a badge.
